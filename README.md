## Abstract

This repository contains the results of my attempts to learn the Rust
programming language. I did this in my usual fashion: by porting my "go to"
learning example, the generic cell rate algorithm. So far, I've successfully
implemented and tested the GCRA in C++, Java, C, Go, and Rust.

## Modules

* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/src/contract.rs - Implements a traffic contract throttle consisting of peak and sustained GCRAs.
* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/src/fletcher.rs - Implements the Fletcher sixteen-bit checksum algorithm.
* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/src/gcra.rs - Implements a Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA) throttle using a virtual scheduler.
* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/src/lib.rs - Combines individual implementation files into rustler library.
* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/src/throttle.rs - Describes the trait for a rate control algorithm.
* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/src/ticks.rs - Implements basic monotonic time functions for use in rate control.
* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/tests/harness/mod.rs - Provides a harness for testing throttles with simulated and real-time event streams.

## Executables

* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/src/bin/fletch.rs - Computes the Fletcher-16 checksum of a data stream admitted from standard input and emitted to standard output.
* com-diag-rustler/Rustler/src/bin/shape.rs - Shapes the data stream admitted from standard input and emitted to standard output.

## Remarks

My experience writing in Rust reminds me of a comment a colleague of
mine made decades ago about the Ada programming language: "If you can
just get your program to compile, it frequently works the first time."

I think my main issue with Rust was how under-documented it is. In
order to do the kinds of things I routinely do (and which are trivial
in Go), you must have an extraordinarily high level of expertise in the
language. Also, because the language is immature and still changing,
many of the examples you find online simply don't compile.  This made the
learning experience especially painful and often a matter of laborious
reverse engineering or trial and error. And unlike Go, I didnâ€™t find
using Rust intuitive; for me, it was difficult to predict its syntax
and semantics. But there is much to admire about Rust.

I especially like Rust's memory management model. Instead of garbage
collecting in the background like Go (and Java (and Python (and ...))),
it uses a limited form of reference counting, and restricts how you can
use references (effectively pointers) so that it can manage the lifetime
of variables mostly through scope. It also restricts how you can use
threads in order to eliminate data races. It's pretty clever. It makes
writing idiomatic Rust challenging, however, because it eliminates
many of the common patterns I use with threads (that not necessarily
a bad thing).

I also appreciate how trivial it was to call a C function from libc
using Rust. Since most stuff I work on entails integrating with some
legacy framework or library (typically to manage some custom hardware),
this is an important feature.

In the past few years of consulting on embedded product development
projects, I've seen a trend in clients bringing in an embedded expert (me)
to handle the low level stuff in C or C++, and use much less expensive
developers working in, for example, Python or JavaScript, to do the higher
level development. With Rust, I would expect this times ten, providing you
could find an actual legitimate Rust expert at all. While I appreciate the
Rust strategy of making thread race conditions or memory leaks virtually
impossible by stringent compile time checking, you have to compare that
with the cost of writing Rust code; the economics of this eludes me.
You have the choice between finding an experienced Rust developer, or
finding an experienced C or C++ developer who can write code without
such flaws. I suspect that as difficult as the latter is, it is a lot
easier than the former, even though the correctness of the Rust code is
probably more credible.

Or you could just write in Go, and get to market a lot quicker.

## Targets

Various versions of this software have at one time or another been installed
and tested with the following combinations of hardware targets and software
platforms. Your mileage may vary.

## Unit Tests

    cd ${HOME}/src/com-diag-rustler/Rustler
    cargo test -- --nocapture --test-threads=1

## Functional Tests

    cd ${HOME}/src/com-diag-rustler/Rustler
    dd if=/dev/urandom count=1000 | ./target/debug/fletch -V -b 512 | ./target/debug/shape -V -p 2048 -s 1024 -b 512 | ./target/debug/fletch -V -b 512 > /dev/null

Valgrind works just fine with Rust, unlike my experience with Go.

    cd ${HOME}/src/com-diag-rustler/Rustler
    dd if=/dev/urandom count=1000 > DATA
    valgrind ./target/debug/fletch -V -b 512 < DATA > /dev/null
    valgrind ./target/debug/shape -V -p 2048 -s 1024 -b 512 < DATA > /dev/null

### usize

Note that on X86_64 sizeof(size_t)==8, while on ARMv7 sizeof(size_t)==4. That
means on the former, Rust usize is 8 bytes, but on the latter its 4 bytes.
